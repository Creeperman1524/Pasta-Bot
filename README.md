# Pasta Bot
 A small bot that I have created for my discord server and my own use

## Commands
1. p!help - Displays a help message with all commands how to use them
1. p!info - Displays information about the bot
1. p!ping - Displays the current ping of the user and bot
1. p!reload - Reloads a command cache if not working properly

### Things to do:
 - [ ] Finish minesweeper
 - [ ] Tetris? (most likely hard to do)
 - [ ] Hangman
 - [ ] Trivia (from an API?)
 - [ ] Family fued (again, from an API?)
 - [ ] Simon says (may be difficult to do)
 - [ ] Name that tune? Lyric?
 - [ ] Game night mode (dedicates a channel and counts the points and gives something special to the person who wins)
